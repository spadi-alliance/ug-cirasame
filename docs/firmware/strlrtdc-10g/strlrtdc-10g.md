# Streaming low-resolution TDC with SiTCP-XG

## Overview

The CIRASAME streaming low-resolution TDC with SiTCP-XG (CIRASAME Str-LRTDC 10G) is a continuous readout TDC with 1ns timing precision.
This firmware is basically the same as CIRASAME Str-LRTDC, but the data link protocol is replaced with SiTCP-XG.
In this user guide, the CIRASAME Str-LRTDC 10G is simply called as Str-LRTDC-10G.

### History

|Version|Date|Changes|
|:----:|:----|:----|
|v2.2|2025.5.29|- Bugfix version of v2.1 <br> - Fixed the bug that the delay function for the trigger assisted mode does not work.|
|v2.1|2025.3.5|- Bugfix version of v2.0. <br> - Enabling the function to generate data words with input throttling type-2 start/end data types. |
|v2.0|2025.1.7|First release version|

## Functions

The internal function is completely the same as that of CIRASAME Str-LRTDC, but some unnecessary functions such as ADC readout are omitted.
See the description about that.

## Local bus modules

The Str-LRTDC-10G includes 8 local bus modules.
The local bus address map is as follows.
